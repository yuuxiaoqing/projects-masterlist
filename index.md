_CruzHacks 2019 Tech Cares 1st Place Winner and UCSC Arts 2nd Place Winner_
This app was designed and created to help people overcome their stage fright and public speaking issues by simulating them in a virtual stage with a spotlight and a group of audiences. The app also analyze the speech the user makes in the virtual environment and gives helpful tips and feedback to the user so they can improve next time. I coded the website for the app and I also thought of the idea for the app.
